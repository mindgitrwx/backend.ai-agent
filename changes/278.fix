Stabilize container lifecycle management.
- Let the container cleanup task to explicitly wait for the container destruction task
  because the clean event may be fired and handled before the docker's container destroy API returns.
- Do not create/destroy libzmq contexts for individual containers and reuse a single
  global context, because doing so may hang up when there are many concurrent
  creation/destruction operations going on.
- Explicitly clean up async generators related to log collection.
- Limit the concurrency of container creation and destruction to 4 using async semaphore.
- Add more category switches to control verbosity of debug logs. (`events`, `alloc-map`, `kernel-config`)
- Add explicit timeouts when calling the docker stats API because it may hang under high loads,
  but this seems to be not a complete solution yet.
